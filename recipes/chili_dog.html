    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      This recipe makes a wonderful chili sauce for hot dogs. Just place a
      grilled hot dog in a bun and top with chili, grated Cheddar cheese, and
      diced onions. Serve immediately. If halving this recipe, cover the pot for
      half of the two hour simmer.
    </p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>2 pounds ground beef</li>
      <li>2 (14.5 ounce) cans reduced-sodium beef broth</li>
      <li>1 (28 ounce) can crushed tomatoes with puree</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons chili powder</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon paprika</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon onion powder</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon garlic powder</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon kosher salt</li>
      <li>Â¼ teaspoon cayenne pepper</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat. Cook and stir beef in the
        hot skillet until browned and crumbly, 5 to 7 minutes; drain and discard
        grease. Add beef broth to ground beef; bring to a boil. Reduce heat to
        medium-low and simmer until liquid is slightly reduced, about 30
        minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Mix tomatoes with puree, chili powder, paprika, onion powder, garlic
        powder, salt, and cayenne pepper into ground beef mixture. Simmer,
        stirring occasionally, until mixture is very thick, about 1 1/2 hours.
      </li>
    </ol>
